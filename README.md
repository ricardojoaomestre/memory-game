# The-memory-game

This is a project inspired in the traditional memory game we've all played our entire life.

The game is simple: you have to find the emoji pairs in the less amount of clicks possible. That's it! :-)

There are 8 different emojis to match with their pairs.

I hope you enjoy it! ;)
